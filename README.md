# CODE CHALLANGE 1 [Student Grade Genarator]
The project involves creating a student-grade-genarator which is done with js (Javascript) commands and prompts a user to input student marks.

<Project Procedures:>
1.I declared a variable fuction named (myCalc).
2.Inside the function i created 2 variables (percent) && (yourGrade). The percent variable stores the value-calculation from marks to marks percentage while variable grade stores the grading characters(A,B,C,D..).
3.Created an if / else if / else loop expressions with conditions for grading.
4.Did a return variable on (percent) && (yourGrade).
5.Used a prompt() method to display a dialog box prompting a user to enter student marks.

# CODE CHALLANGE 2  [Speed Detector challange]
The project involves creating a student-speed-detector which is done with js (Javascript) commands and prompts a user to input.

<Projet Procedures:>
1.Declared a function named speedDetector().
2.Inside the function i declared 3 variables (speed_limit, km_per_point && 
demerit_point) using const key-word with the values (70, 5) and (km_per_point-- storing the calculation to determine the demerit point one gets above the speed limit).
3.Created an if / else loop expressions with conditions. 
4.Did a return variable on (demerit_point).
5.Used a prompt() method to display a dialog box prompting a user enter the speed.

# CODE CHALLANGE 3 [Speed Detector challange]
The project involves creating a Net Salary Calculator which is done with js (Javascript) commands, and prompts a user to input gross salary so as to deduct the (Nhif, Nssf and paytax).

<Projet Procedures:>
1.I declared 4 functions (netSalaryCalculator, payeeTaxCalculator, nhifCalculator and nssfCalculator,).
2.Inside each function i declared variables (netSalary, payTax, nhif and nssf), which each equal the gross salary.  
3.Created an if / else if / else loop expressions with conditions for each individual function with differnt conditions.
4.Did returns for individual functions.
5.Used a prompt() method to display a dialog box prompting a user enter the gross Salary.
<NOTE:>
Each fuctions parameters is the same so as to recieve same gross salary input and generate total salary less the individual diductions per fuction.
